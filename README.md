# gitcrypt_windows_support
Added this project to test the windows functionality for git crypt
The gpg keys are generated in the windows machine.
For using the git crypt, the linux containers are created. All the pub and private gpg keys 
for that user are imported into this container for using the encryption and decryption functionality
